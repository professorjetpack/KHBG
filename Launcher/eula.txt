Truthfully, I really don't think this is necessary. I know you guys are all
good people but this is "proper" procedure. Well 1, thanks for actually
installing this. I know for most of you this is really just wasting your space.
So, now to the legal stuff. First and formost I do not own any of the models
or sound effects. All of them have been created by other fantastic authors
and all rights to those models and sounds go to their original authors
on freesound.org and turboquid.com. The fonts used in this project are again
not created by me and rights go to their original authors as well. Best of
thanks to Pierre / Dynamedions for creating that awesome soundtrack that's
played when there is 1:20 left in a game. Now as the end user you are allowed to
################################################################################
1a. Play the actual game, that's a given. However you also can record this game
and yes monetize from video recordings. I have no clue why you would ever do
such a thing but I am allowing you to if you wish.
2a. I'm really not sure how an eula is supposed to be formatted so let's get to
what you're not allowed to do.
As the end user you agree that:
###############################################################################
1. You will not claim any or part of this software as your own. This of course
excludes the artists of the sound tracks, models and fonts, the programmers of
the irrklang, stb_image, openGL and glfw. Oh and I guess the programmers of
the Win32 api and I guess while we're at it the makes of C++.
2. You will not redistribute or sell this software. Not only is this game not
worth anything, the licensing of some assets and libraries used here do not
allow it. Redistributing any or part of this software is unathorized. Exception
granted to all the artists who contributed to this. And by contribute, I mean
allow free usage to random people who just snag your work of websites. Especially
to Pierre / Dynamedions. I just snagged that wonderful piece off youtube and I
sincerely hope I am crediting you correctly as the video I saw was a reupload
3. You will not modify any part of this software in any way.
4. You will sell me your soul. At any time I may call upon you to commit acts
in my name and you are obligated to follow through with those acts. If you do
not agree with this term, email me and I will void this condition for you
5. You will not find any way to make any kind of modification that will give
you an unfair advantage. What is commonly known as 'hacking' the game. Admin
abuse is perfectly allowed on private servers. In fact, I encourage it :)
6. You will not allowed to accept 'donation' for this game.
7. You are not legally authorized to popularize and spread this game via any
medium, including by word of mouth. While I will most likely not make a big
issue about it, if I wake up one day and this crap is trending on youtube,
you agree that on my whim you may owe me up to a $250,000 fine. The fine may
be given out whenever I feel like it, you agree that my youtube example is not
the only way this term can be applied.

Once again thanks. And I hope you'll have at least 10 minutes of fun.
