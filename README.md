This game was developed in C++ and OpenGL. Some graphic features implemented are:
* Shadow Mapping and Cascading Shadow Mapping
* Blinn-Phong Lighting Model
* Normal Mapping
* Skyboxes
* Gamma Correction
* Model loading using Assimp
A TCP server connects the clients to allow for multiplayer 

Furthermore, an Installer was developed, which used GDI to create a nice little pong game to play while downloading and installing KFBR
##
As another note, this project was developed before I knew much about design patterns or good programming practices.
